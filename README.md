# Green Air Inc. Process Mining Project

For the code review please look at the master branch of this project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the analysis and documentation for the procurement process of Green Air Inc., using Python and Jupyter Notebooks to apply process mining techniques. The goal is to uncover inefficiencies, deviations from standard procedures, and opportunities for optimization within the procurement process.

## Background
Green Air Inc. has highlighted concerns regarding the length and compliance of its procurement process, suspecting it affects both finances and operations significantly. This project uses process mining to analyze data extracted from Green Air's ERP system, aiming to provide a thorough assessment of the current process flow.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install Jupyter Notebooks: Run `pip install notebook` to install.

### Data Integration and Analysis
1. **Data Preparation**: Use Python to preprocess the ERP system data into a suitable format for process mining.
2. **Analysis**: Load the processed data into Jupyter Notebooks for detailed analysis.

## Analysis Goals
- Confirm whether the process adheres to the standard model.
- Identify and quantify variants of the process.
- Detect conflicts in the separation of functions.
- Identify opportunities for process optimization.
- Propose potential improvement initiatives.
